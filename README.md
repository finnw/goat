## Overview
The goat project (Go Application Template) is a set of Go packages that attempt to tie common application requirements together into an easy-to-use, yet scalable, application framework suited for a wide range of application types; From command-line tools to high-performance application servers. I often notice that, in building new applications, there is a common base pattern that I tend to follow - a set of core components and behaviors - which are not application specific, but which always seem to prove useful. Goat is an attempt to create an abstraction for those patterns so that future endeavours can be more focused on application specific logic.

### License

### Status
Just getting started. This project isn't likely to be useful to anyone just yet :)
